# Hylo Wallet Tracker â€” Backend Progress **by Blocks**

## Block A â€” Helios Connectivity

### **Overview**

Establishes core Solana RPC connectivity layer using Helios, providing both HTTP and WebSocket clients with robust error handling, reconnection logic, and commitment-aware operations.

**Module Path:** `/internal/solana`  
**Dependencies:** Helios RPC endpoints (`RPC_HTTP_URL`, `RPC_WS_URL`)

### **Overall Progress**

- [x] **Phase A1:** Foundation & HTTP Client _(4/4 tasks completed)_ âœ…
- [ ] **Phase A2:** WebSocket Client & Subscriptions _(ON HOLD)_ ðŸš§
- [x] **Phase A3:** Solana Service & Health (Minimal) _(3/3 tasks completed)_ âœ…
- [ ] **Phase A4:** Integration & Performance Validation _(0/3 tasks completed)_

**Block A Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress _(Phases A1+A3 complete, A2 on hold | 2/3 active phases complete)_

### **Phase A1: Foundation & HTTP Client** _(Independent - 3-4 hours)_

**Deliverables:**

- [x] HTTP client with retry logic and timeout handling
- [x] Core RPC methods: `GetAccount`, `GetTransaction`, `GetSignaturesForAddress`
- [x] Comprehensive test suite

**Components:**

- [x] `config.go` - Configuration struct and validation
- [x] `types.go` - Solana-specific types (Address, Slot, Commitment)
- [x] `http_client.go` - HTTP client implementation
- [x] `http_client_test.go` - HTTP client tests
- [x] `errors.go` - Custom error types and wrapping
- [x] `testdata/` - Mock JSON responses for tests

**Implementation Tasks:**

1. **Config & Types** (30 min) âœ…

   - [x] Add validation for configuration parameters

2. **HTTP Client Core** (2 hours) âœ…

   - [x] Implement base HTTP client with proper timeout handling
   - [x] Add exponential backoff retry logic (1s â†’ 2s â†’ 4s â†’ 8s, max 3 retries)

### **Phase A2: WebSocket Client & Subscriptions** _(ON HOLD - 3-4 hours)_ ðŸš§

> **Status:** Deferred in favor of HTTP-first MVP approach. Will implement after core business logic (Blocks B + C) is working.

**Planned Deliverables:**

- [ ] WebSocket client with subscription management
- [ ] Account and logs subscription methods
- [ ] Message parsing and routing
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with mock WebSocket server

**Rationale for Deferral:**

- Focus on core functionality first (wallet balances, price engine)
- Validate business logic before adding real-time complexity
- HTTP polling can provide near real-time updates for MVP
- Simpler deployment and testing without WebSocket dependencies

### **Phase A3: Solana Service & Health (Minimal)** _(Depends on A1 only - 1-2 hours)_

> **Scope:** HTTP-only service bootstrap and health monitoring. Simplified from original A3 due to A2 deferral.

**Deliverables:**

- [x] Solana service bootstrap and lifecycle management
- [x] HTTP-only health monitoring and status
- [x] Health check endpoint for production readiness (simplified to `/health`)
- [x] Service integration in server.go

**Components:**

- [x] `service.go` - Solana service with HTTP client lifecycle
- [x] `service_test.go` - Service tests with health scenarios
- [x] `health.go` - Health status types and monitoring logic

**Implementation Tasks:**

1. **Service Bootstrap** (45 min) âœ…

   - [x] Create `Service` struct managing HTTP client lifecycle
   - [x] Implement `NewService(config)` with validation
   - [x] Add `GetHTTPClient()` access method
   - [x] Graceful shutdown with `Close()` method

2. **Health Monitoring** (45 min) âœ…

   - [x] Track HTTP client health (last successful request)
   - [x] Implement `Health(ctx)` method for external probing
   - [x] Health status struct with timestamps and error tracking
   - [x] Integration with server health endpoints

3. **Server Integration** (30 min) âœ…

   - [x] Bootstrap Solana service in `server.go`
   - [x] Add health route: `/health` (simplified to single endpoint)
   - [x] Environment configuration loading
   - [x] Dependency injection pattern

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Solana service bootstraps successfully from config âœ…
- [x] Health checks accurately reflect HTTP connection status âœ…
- [x] Health endpoints return proper HTTP status codes âœ…
- [x] Service integrates cleanly with existing server structure âœ…
- [x] Graceful shutdown completes within 5s âœ…
- [x] Tests achieve >80% coverage **(82.8%)** âœ…

### **Dependencies & Phase Relationships**

```
A1 (HTTP Client) â”€â”€â–º A3 (Service & Health - Minimal) â”€â”€â–º A4 (Integration) â”€â”€â–º B (Tokens) â”€â”€â–º C (Price Engine)
                â”‚
                â””â”€â”€â–º A2 (WebSocket) [ON HOLD] ðŸš§
```

**Phase Independence:**

- **A3 (Minimal)** depends only on A1, much simpler scope
- **A2** deferred until after core business logic (Blocks B + C)
- **A4** simplified to HTTP-only integration testing
- **Block B & C** can begin after A3 completion

**Testing Strategy:**

- Each phase has its own comprehensive test suite
- Earlier phases use mocks/stubs for external dependencies
- Later phases include integration testing against real services
- All phases maintain >90% test coverage requirement
