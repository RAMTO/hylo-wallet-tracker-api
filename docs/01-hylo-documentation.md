# hyUSD & xSOL

_Learn about Hylo’s two core tokens - hyUSD stablecoin and xSOL leveraged token_

## Overview

**Hylo** is a decentralized stablecoin protocol native to **Solana**. Hylo differs from traditional stablecoins in that its backing collateral consists of **SOL LSTs**, not cash or treasury bills. The main risk of using SOL as collateral is the price volatility inherent to the cryptocurrency market, discussed in depth _decentralized-stablecoins_.

Hylo achieves a **delta-neutral** position in its collateral with a radically different and autonomous strategy made possible by a simple equation and two tokens, **hyUSD** and **xSOL**.

---

## Two Tokens, One Pool

Hylo emits two tokens: **hyUSD**, the flagship stablecoin, and **xSOL**, a tokenized leveraged long position on SOL.

hyUSD and xSOL are backed by a diverse basket of LSTs called the **collateral pool**. At any point in time, the sum of the two tokens’ market capitalizations is equivalent to the total dollar value locked in the pool. This property can be expressed with the Hylo invariant equation:

```
Collateral TVL = hyUSD Supply × hyUSD Price + xSOL Supply × xSOL Price
```

What makes Hylo unique is the symbiotic relationship between xSOL and hyUSD. **xSOL absorbs SOL price movements**, allowing hyUSD to maintain a **1:1 USD peg** in the face of market volatility. Simultaneously, **excess value generated by the protocol’s LST reserves** benefits xSOL holders with outsized gains.

---

## Pricing hyUSD & xSOL

The price of the **hyUSD** token is always fixed at **$1 USD** — it’s a stablecoin!

The price of **xSOL** is calculated from the amount of **“variable reserve”** in the collateral pool, which is the excess value not reserved to back hyUSD. The Hylo equation can be rearranged to show how the protocol automatically adjusts xSOL’s price:

```
xSOL Price = ( Collateral TVL − hyUSD Supply ) / xSOL Supply
```

As the value of the variable reserve grows (e.g., SOL appreciates), the price of xSOL **increases with effective leverage**. Likewise, if the SOL price dips the value of xSOL **decreases**, absorbing volatility witnessed by the entire pool to maintain hyUSD’s peg.

---

## Effective Leverage on xSOL

Effective leverage is a dynamic measure reflecting the xSOL token’s exposure to price movements in the underlying SOL. It is computed as the ratio of the system TVL to the market capitalization of xSOL:

```
Effective Leverage = Collateral TVL / xSOL Market Cap
```

xSOL’s leverage fluctuates dynamically with activity. It **rises** when hyUSD is **minted** or xSOL is **redeemed**, as these increase the amount of collateral relative to xSOL supply. Conversely, it **falls** when hyUSD is **burned** or new xSOL is **minted**. The effective leverage is inversely related to the proportion of TVL in xSOL: a higher xSOL fraction results in **lower leverage**, as shown in the graphic below.

Hylo’s stability mechanisms, detailed in _risk-management_, ensure that the effective leverage on xSOL stays within a **target range**.

---

## Notation

- **Collateral TVL** — Total dollar value of the collateral pool
- **hyUSD Supply** — Total outstanding hyUSD (assumed $1.00 per unit)
- **xSOL Supply** — Total outstanding xSOL
- **xSOL Market Cap** — `xSOL Supply × xSOL Price`

# Hylo Equations

_Technical breakdown of the key equations powering Hylo’s protocol_

## True LST value

For calculation purposes, both **xSOL** and **hyUSD** are priced using the pure **SOL** price. However, since they are backed by **Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)**, we need to accurately capture the price of these LSTs at any time. Using the market price of LSTs could pose problems during severe volatility (peg loss, thin liquidity, or manipulation relative to SOL). Therefore, we use a **SOL value calculator** based on the amount of SOL held in each LST stake pool to determine the **true LST price**.

The true price of an LST in SOL is defined as:

```
True LST Price = Amount of SOL in Stake Pool / Total LST Supply
```

## SOL/USD Oracle

To calculate the value of **hyUSD in SOL** (so it remains pegged 1:1 to USD), we require the **SOL price**. For this, Hylo uses the **Pyth EMA SOL/USD** price oracle.

## Net Asset Value (NAV) calculation for hyUSD and xSOL

The **Net Asset Value (NAV)** expresses how much both tokens are worth **in SOL**. Because SOL’s price is volatile, the NAV of hyUSD must be continuously adjusted to maintain the 1:1 USD peg.

**hyUSD NAV in SOL**:

```
hyUSD NAV_in_SOL = 1 / SOL Price
```

**xSOL NAV in SOL** (based on the hyUSD NAV in SOL):

```
xSOL NAV_in_SOL = ( Total SOL in Reserve − ( hyUSD NAV_in_SOL × hyUSD Supply ) ) / xSOL Supply
```

## Collateral Ratio calculation

The **Collateral Ratio** indicates the health level of hyUSD. It must be tracked accurately to activate stability modes when needed. It is calculated as:

```
Collateral Ratio = Total SOL in Reserve / ( hyUSD NAV in SOL × hyUSD Supply )
```

## Stability pool APY calculation

The stability pool **APY** depends on (a) the percentage of SOL value being staked, (b) the APY of the reserve, and (c) the chosen percentage of **Revenue Distribution**.

**Percentage of staked SOL**:

```
%_staked_SOL = Total SOL in Reserve / ( hyUSD Staked Amount × hyUSD NAV in SOL )
```

**Average Reserve Yield**:

```
Average Reserve Yield = ( Σ_{i=1..x} ( Supply_{LST_i} × Price_{LST_i} × APY_{LST_i} ) ) / Total SOL in Reserve
```

Given the above, the **stability pool APY** is:

```
APY = Average Reserve Yield × %_revenue_distribution × %_staked_SOL
```

## xSOL Effective Leverage

xSOL’s **effective leverage** changes over time. First compute the **virtual xSOL market cap** (in SOL):

```
Market Cap_xSOL = NAV_xSOL × Supply_xSOL
```

Then compute leverage:

```
Effective Leverage_xSOL = Total SOL in Reserve / Market Cap_xSOL
```

## **Behavior:** effective leverage tends to increase rapidly as the **Collateral Ratio** approaches **100%**, and it tends toward **1** (tracking SOL one-for-one) as the Collateral Ratio rises well above 100%.
